# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
  *I am confident with the `each` method.*
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
  *Felt some pressure, for sure. Experienced productive and Unproductive struggle. It was good to reach out to people I know and the internet machine to solve the problems.*
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
  *I need to practice expanding outside the written curriculum and research solutions.*
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
  *No questions right now. There are many resources at my disposal to get my questions answered.*
